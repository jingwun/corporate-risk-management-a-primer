description: Alan Greenspan \* The development \* of our paradigms for containing risk has emphasized dispersion of risk to those willing, and presumably able, to bear it. If risk is properly dispersed, shocks to the overall economic system will be better absorbed and less likely to create cascading failures that could threaten financial stability. <p> -- Alan Greenspan <p>The financial risk that arises from uncertainty can be managed. Risk management is about how firms actively select the type and level of risk that it is appropriate for them to assume. Over the past 15 years, risk management has become widely acknowledged as one of the most powerful forces in the world's financial markets. Unfortunately, risk management has not consistently been able to prevent market distuptions or to prevent business accounting scandals given its double-edged nature - every financial instrument that allows a company to transfer risk also allows other corporations to assume that risk as a counterpary in the same market. In a world that is increasing driven by risk management concepts and technologies, we need to look more carefully at the increasingly fluid and complex nature of risk itself, and at how to determine whether any change in a corporation's risk profile serves the interests of stakeholders.
